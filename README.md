## Pie/Donut Chart

This is a short demonstration on a way to switch between pie chart and donut chart visualizations, done for a lab in my Visualization class.

### Interaction

The visualization handles hovering over elements in the chart, and pressing the button to toggle between the two types.

### Credit

This was made as a partner project with Dan Berman.
